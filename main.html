    <h3>I wanna tell you about why I take "OpenSourceSWdevelop"class.
        <br> Last year, I joined the university union club, "LIKELION" by Doohee Lee and then for the first time, learned a lot of things like HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Django and so on.
        you know,It's so amazing! I totally get involved in making something. So this semester, I decided to make web-service with team members through this class.
